        Hello, this is a new Netology!
        Once upon a time, Netology began with intensive courses in online marketing.
        Then there were courses in design, development, analytics and management.
        We grow by ourselves and help students grow: from beginners to confident professionals.
        But the most important thing remains with us: we believe that everyone has the power to want more, aim higher, and run faster.
        Our mission is to help us embark on the path of growth and start a chain of changes -> "https://netolo.gy/fyb"</string>
